  <h2 id="introduction"><span class="secno">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

  <h3 id="background"><span class="secno">1.1 </span>Background</h3>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>
  <p>The World Wide Web's markup language has always been HTML. HTML was primarily designed as a
  language for semantically describing scientific documents, although its general design and
  adaptations over the years have enabled it to be used to describe a number of other types of
  documents.</p>

  <p>The main area that has not been adequately addressed by HTML is a vague subject referred to as
  Web Applications. This specification attempts to rectify this, while at the same time updating the
  HTML specifications to address issues raised in the past few years.</p>


  <h3 id="audience"><span class="secno">1.2 </span>Audience</h3>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>
  <p>This specification is intended for authors of documents and scripts that use the features
  defined in this specification<span class="impl">, implementors of tools that operate on pages that
  use the features defined in this specification, and individuals wishing to establish the
  correctness of documents or implementations with respect to the requirements of this
  specification</span>.</p>

  <p>This document is probably not suited to readers who do not already have at least a passing
  familiarity with Web technologies, as in places it sacrifices clarity for precision, and brevity
  for completeness. More approachable tutorials and authoring guides can provide a gentler
  introduction to the topic.</p>

  <p>In particular, familiarity with the basics of DOM is necessary for a complete understanding of
  some of the more technical parts of this specification. An understanding of Web IDL, HTTP, XML,
  Unicode, character encodings, JavaScript, and CSS will also be helpful in places but is not
  essential.</p>


  <h3 id="scope"><span class="secno">1.3 </span>Scope</h3>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>
  <p>This specification is limited to providing a semantic-level markup language and associated
  semantic-level scripting APIs for authoring accessible pages on the Web ranging from static
  documents to dynamic applications.</p>

  <p>The scope of this specification does not include providing mechanisms for media-specific
  customization of presentation (although default rendering rules for Web browsers are included at
  the end of this specification, and several mechanisms for hooking into CSS are provided as part of
  the language).</p>

  <p>The scope of this specification is not to describe an entire operating system. In particular,
  hardware configuration software, image manipulation tools, and applications that users would be
  expected to use with high-end workstations on a daily basis are out of scope. In terms of
  applications, this specification is targeted specifically at applications that would be expected
  to be used by users on an occasional basis, or regularly but from disparate locations, with low
  CPU requirements. Examples of such applications include online purchasing systems, searching
  systems, games (especially multiplayer online games), public telephone books or address books,
  communications software (e-mail clients, instant messaging clients, discussion software), document
  editing software, etc.</p>


  <h3 id="history-0"><span class="secno">1.4 </span>History</h3>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>
  <p>For its first five years (1990-1995), HTML went through a number of revisions and experienced a
  number of extensions, primarily hosted first at CERN, and then at the IETF.</p>

  <p>With the creation of the W3C, HTML's development changed venue again. A first abortive attempt
  at extending HTML in 1995 known as HTML 3.0 then made way to a more pragmatic approach known as
  HTML 3.2, which was completed in 1997. HTML4 quickly followed later that same year.</p>

  <p>The following year, the W3C membership decided to stop evolving HTML and instead begin work on
  an XML-based equivalent, called XHTML.  <!-- http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/future/#summary -->  This
  effort started with a reformulation of HTML4 in XML, known as XHTML 1.0, which added no new
  features except the new serialization, and which was completed in 2000. After XHTML 1.0, the W3C's
  focus turned to making it easier for other working groups to extend XHTML, under the banner of
  XHTML Modularization. In parallel with this, the W3C also worked on a new language that was not
  compatible with the earlier HTML and XHTML languages, calling it XHTML2.</p>

  <p>Around the time that HTML's evolution was stopped in 1998, parts of the API for HTML developed
  by browser vendors were specified and published under the name DOM Level 1 (in 1998) and DOM Level
  2 Core and DOM Level 2 HTML (starting in 2000 and culminating in 2003). These efforts then petered
  out, with some DOM Level 3 specifications published in 2004 but the working group being closed
  before all the Level 3 drafts were completed.</p>

  <p>In 2003, the publication of XForms, a technology which was positioned as the next generation of
  Web forms, sparked a renewed interest in evolving HTML itself, rather than finding replacements
  for it. This interest was borne from the realization that XML's deployment as a Web technology was
  limited to entirely new technologies (like RSS and later Atom), rather than as a replacement for
  existing deployed technologies (like HTML).</p>

  <p>A proof of concept to show that it was possible to extend HTML4's forms to provide many of the
  features that XForms 1.0 introduced, without requiring browsers to implement rendering engines
  that were incompatible with existing HTML Web pages, was the first result of this renewed
  interest. At this early stage, while the draft was already publicly available, and input was
  already being solicited from all sources, the specification was only under Opera Software's
  copyright.</p>

  <p>The idea that HTML's evolution should be reopened was tested at a W3C workshop in 2004, where
  some of the principles that underlie the HTML5 work (described below), as well as the
  aforementioned early draft proposal covering just forms-related features, were presented to the
  W3C jointly by Mozilla and Opera. The proposal was rejected on the grounds that the proposal
  conflicted with the previously chosen direction for the Web's evolution; the W3C staff and
  membership voted to continue developing XML-based replacements instead.</p>

  <p>Shortly thereafter, Apple, Mozilla, and Opera jointly announced their intent to continue
  working on the effort under the umbrella of a new venue called the WHATWG. A public mailing list
  was created, and the draft was moved to the WHATWG site. The copyright was subsequently amended to
  be jointly owned by all three vendors, and to allow reuse of the specification.</p>

  <p>The WHATWG was based on several core principles, in particular that technologies need to be
  backwards compatible, that specifications and implementations need to match even if this means
  changing the specification rather than the implementations, and that specifications need to be
  detailed enough that implementations can achieve complete interoperability without
  reverse-engineering each other.</p>

  <p>The latter requirement in particular required that the scope of the HTML5 specification include
  what had previously been specified in three separate documents: HTML4, XHTML1, and DOM2 HTML. It
  also meant including significantly more detail than had previously been considered the norm.</p>

  <p>In 2006, the W3C indicated an interest to participate in the development of HTML5 after all,
  and in 2007 formed a working group chartered to work with the WHATWG on the development of the
  HTML5 specification. Apple, Mozilla, and Opera allowed the W3C to publish the specification under
  the W3C copyright, while keeping a version with the less restrictive license on the WHATWG
  site.</p>

    <p>For a number of years, both groups then worked together under the same editor: Ian Hickson.
  In 2011, the groups came to the conclusion that they had different goals: the W3C wanted to
  draw a line in the sand for features for a HTML5 Recommendation, while the WHATWG wanted to
  continue working on a Living Standard for HTML, continuously maintaining the specification
  and adding new features. In mid 2012, a new editing team was introduced at the W3C to take
  care of creating a HTML5 Recommendation and prepare a Working Draft for the next HTML
  version.</p>

  <p>Since then, the W3C HTML WG has been cherry picking patches from the WHATWG that resolved
  bugs registered on the W3C HTML specification or more accurately represented implemented
  reality in UAs. At time of publication of this document, patches from the
  <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/">WHATWG HTML specification</a>
  have been merged until revision <a href="http://html5.org/r/8152">8152</a> inclusive. The W3C
  HTML editors have also added patches that resulted from discussions and decisions made by
  the W3C HTML WG as well a bug fixes from bugs not shared by the WHATWG.
  
  </p>

  <p>A separate document is published to document the differences between the HTML specified
  in this document and the language described in the HTML4 specification. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/references.html#refsHTMLDIFF">[HTMLDIFF]</a></p>
  
  <h3 id="design-notes"><span class="secno">1.5 </span>Design notes</h3>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>
  <p>It must be admitted that many aspects of HTML appear at first glance to be nonsensical and
  inconsistent.</p>

  <p>HTML, its supporting DOM APIs, as well as many of its supporting technologies, have been
  developed over a period of several decades by a wide array of people with different priorities
  who, in many cases, did not know of each other's existence.</p>

  <p>Features have thus arisen from many sources, and have not always been designed in especially
  consistent ways. Furthermore, because of the unique characteristics of the Web, implementation
  bugs have often become de-facto, and now de-jure, standards, as content is often unintentionally
  written in ways that rely on them before they can be fixed.</p>

  <p>Despite all this, efforts have been made to adhere to certain design goals. These are described
  in the next few subsections.</p>


  <h4 id="serializability-of-script-execution"><span class="secno">1.5.1 </span>Serializability of script execution</h4>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>
  <p>To avoid exposing Web authors to the complexities of multithreading, the HTML and DOM APIs are
  designed such that no script can ever detect the simultaneous execution of other scripts. Even
  with <a data-anolis-xref="Worker" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#worker">workers</a>, the intent is that the behavior of implementations can
  be thought of as completely serializing the execution of all scripts in all <a data-anolis-xref="browsing
  context" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#browsing-context">browsing contexts</a>.</p>

  <p class="note">The <code data-anolis-xref="dom-navigator-yieldForStorageUpdates"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/webappapis.html#dom-navigator-yieldforstorageupdates">navigator.yieldForStorageUpdates()</a></code> method, in
  this model, is equivalent to allowing other scripts to run while the calling script is
  blocked.</p>


  <h4 id="compliance-with-other-specifications"><span class="secno">1.5.2 </span>Compliance with other specifications</h4>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>
  <p>This specification interacts with and relies on a wide variety of other specifications. In
  certain circumstances, unfortunately, conflicting needs have led to this specification violating
  the requirements of these other specifications. Whenever this has occurred, the transgressions
  have each been noted as a "<dfn id="willful-violation">willful violation</dfn>", and the reason for the violation has
  been noted.</p>

  <h4 id="extensibility"><span class="secno">1.5.3 </span>Extensibility</h4>
  
    <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>  
    <p>HTML has a wide number of extensibility mechanisms that can be used for adding semantics in a
  safe manner:</p>

  <ul><li>Authors can use the <code data-anolis-xref="attr-class"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#classes">class</a></code> attribute to extend elements,
   effectively creating their own elements, while using the most applicable existing "real" HTML
   element, so that browsers and other tools that don't know of the extension can still support it
   somewhat well. This is the tack used by microformats, for example.</li>

   <li>Authors can include data for inline client-side scripts or server-side site-wide scripts to
   process using the <code data-anolis-xref="attr-data-*"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#attr-data-*">data-*=""</a></code> attributes. These are guaranteed to
   never be touched by browsers, and allow scripts to include data on HTML elements that scripts can
   then look for and process.</li>

   <li>Authors can use the <code data-anolis-xref="meta"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/document-metadata.html#the-meta-element">&lt;meta name="" content=""&gt;</a></code> mechanism to
   include page-wide metadata by registering <a data-anolis-xref="concept-meta-extensions" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/document-metadata.html#concept-meta-extensions">extensions to the
   predefined set of metadata names</a>.</li>

   <li>Authors can use the <code data-anolis-xref="attr-hyperlink-rel"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/links.html#attr-hyperlink-rel">rel=""</a></code> mechanism to annotate
   links with specific meanings by registering <a data-anolis-xref="concept-rel-extensions" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/links.html#concept-rel-extensions">extensions to
   the predefined set of link types</a>. This is also used by microformats. Additionally, 
   absolute URLs that do not contain any non-ASCII characters, nor 
   characters in the range U+0041 (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A) through 
   U+005A (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z) (inclusive), may be used as link 
   types.</li><!--FORK-->

   <li>Authors can embed raw data using the <code data-anolis-xref="script"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/scripting-1.html#the-script-element">&lt;script type=""&gt;</a></code>
   mechanism with a custom type, for further handling by inline or server-side scripts.</li>

   <li>Authors can create <a data-anolis-xref="plugin" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#plugin">plugins</a> and invoke them using the
   <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#the-embed-element">embed</a></code> element. This is how Flash works.</li>

   <li>Authors can extend APIs using the JavaScript prototyping mechanism. This is widely used by
   script libraries, for instance.</li><!--MD-->




  </ul><h3 id="html-vs-xhtml"><span class="secno">1.6 </span>HTML vs XHTML</h3>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>
  <p>This specification defines an abstract language for describing documents and applications, and
  some APIs for interacting with in-memory representations of resources that use this language.</p>

  <p>The in-memory representation is known as "DOM HTML", or "the DOM" for short.</p>

  <p>There are various concrete syntaxes that can be used to transmit resources that use this
  abstract language, two of which are defined in this specification.</p>

  <p>The first such concrete syntax is the HTML syntax. This is the format suggested for most
  authors. It is compatible with most legacy Web browsers. If a document is transmitted with the
  <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/iana.html#text/html">text/html</a></code> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#mime-type">MIME type</a>, then it will be processed as an HTML document by
  Web browsers. This specification defines version 5.0 of the HTML syntax, known as "HTML 5".</p>

  <p>The second concrete syntax is the XHTML syntax, which is an application of XML. When a document
  is transmitted with an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#xml-mime-type">XML MIME type</a>, such as <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/iana.html#application/xhtml+xml">application/xhtml+xml</a></code>,
  then it is treated as an XML document by Web browsers, to be parsed by an XML processor. Authors
  are reminded that the processing for XML and HTML differs; in particular, even minor syntax errors
  will prevent a document labeled as XML from being rendered fully, whereas they would be ignored in
  the HTML syntax. This specification defines version 5.0 of the XHTML syntax, known as
  "XHTML 5".</p>

  <p>The DOM, the HTML syntax, and the XHTML syntax cannot all represent the same content. For
  example, namespaces cannot be represented using the HTML syntax, but they are supported in the DOM
  and in the XHTML syntax. Similarly, documents that use the <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/scripting-1.html#the-noscript-element">noscript</a></code> feature can be
  represented using the HTML syntax, but cannot be represented with the DOM or in the XHTML syntax.
  Comments that contain the string "<code data-anolis-xref="">--&gt;</code>" can only be represented in the
  DOM, not in the HTML and XHTML syntaxes.</p>


  <h3 id="structure-of-this-specification"><span class="secno">1.7 </span>Structure of this specification</h3>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>
  <p>This specification is divided into the following major sections:</p>

  <dl><dt><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/introduction.html#introduction">Introduction</a></dt>

   <dd>Non-normative materials providing a context for the HTML standard.</dd>


   <dt><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#infrastructure">Common infrastructure</a></dt>

   <dd>The conformance classes, algorithms, definitions, and the common underpinnings of the rest of
   the specification.</dd>


   <dt><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#dom">Semantics, structure, and APIs of HTML documents</a></dt>

   <dd>Documents are built from elements. These elements form a tree using the DOM. This section
   defines the features of this DOM, as well as introducing the features common to all elements, and
   the concepts used in defining elements.</dd>


   <dt><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/semantics.html#semantics">The elements of HTML</a></dt>

   <dd>Each element has a predefined meaning, which is explained in this section. Rules for authors
   on how to use the element<span class="impl">, along with user agent requirements for how to
   handle each element,</span> are also given. This includes large signature features of HTML such
   as video playback and subtitles, form controls and form submission, and a 2D graphics API known
   as the HTML canvas.</dd><!--MD-->





   <dt><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#browsers">Loading Web pages</a></dt>

   <dd>HTML documents do not exist in a vacuum — this section defines many of the features
   that affect environments that deal with multiple pages, such as Web browsers and offline
   caching of Web applications.</dd>


   <dt><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/webappapis.html#webappapis">Web application APIs</a></dt>

   <dd>This section introduces basic features for scripting of applications in HTML.</dd>


   <dt><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/editing.html#editing">User interaction</a></dt>

   <dd>HTML documents can provide a number of mechanisms for users to interact with and modify
   content, which are described in this section, such as how focus works.</dd><!--POSTMSG-->

   <dt><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/the-xhtml-syntax.html#xhtml">The XHTML syntax</a></dt>

   <dd>All of these features would be for naught if they couldn't be represented in a serialized
   form and sent to other people, and so these sections define the syntaxes of HTML and XHTML<span class="impl">, along with rules for how to parse content using those syntaxes</span>.</dd>


   <dt><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/rendering.html#rendering">Rendering</a></dt>

   <dd>This section defines the default rendering rules for Web browsers.</dd>


  </dl><p>There are also some appendices, listing <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/obsolete.html#obsolete">obsolete features</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/iana.html#iana">IANA considerations</a>, and several indices.</p>



  <h4 id="how-to-read-this-specification"><span class="secno">1.7.1 </span>How to read this specification</h4>

  <p>This specification should be read like all other specifications. First, it should be read
  cover-to-cover, multiple times. Then, it should be read backwards at least once. Then it should be
  read by picking random sections from the contents list and following all the cross-references.</p>

  <p>As described in the conformance requirements section below, this specification describes
  conformance criteria for a variety of conformance classes. In particular, there are conformance
  requirements that apply to <em>producers</em>, for example authors and the documents they create,
  and there are conformance requirements that apply to <em>consumers</em>, for example Web browsers.
  They can be distinguished by what they are requiring: a requirement on a producer states what is
  allowed, while a requirement on a consumer states how software is to act.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>For example, "the <code data-anolis-xref="">foo</code> attribute's value must be a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#valid-integer">valid
   integer</a>" is a requirement on producers, as it lays out the allowed values; in contrast,
   the requirement "the <code data-anolis-xref="">foo</code> attribute's value must be parsed using the
   <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#rules-for-parsing-integers">rules for parsing integers</a>" is a requirement on consumers, as it describes how to
   process the content.</p>

  </div>

  <p><strong>Requirements on producers have no bearing whatsoever on consumers.</strong></p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Continuing the above example, a requirement stating that a particular attribute's value is
   constrained to being a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#valid-integer">valid integer</a> emphatically does <em>not</em> imply anything
   about the requirements on consumers. It might be that the consumers are in fact required to treat
   the attribute as an opaque string, completely unaffected by whether the value conforms to the
   requirements or not. It might be (as in the previous example) that the consumers are required to
   parse the value using specific rules that define how invalid (non-numeric in this case) values
   are to be processed.</p>

  </div>

  </dd></dl><h3 id="fingerprint"><span class="secno">1.8 </span>Privacy concerns</h3>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>
  <p>Some features of HTML trade user convenience for a measure of user privacy.</p>

  <p>In general, due to the Internet's architecture, a user can be distinguished from another by the
  user's IP address. IP addresses do not perfectly match to a user; as a user moves from device to
  device, or from network to network, their IP address will change; similarly, NAT routing, proxy
  servers, and shared computers enable packets that appear to all come from a single IP address to
  actually map to multiple users. Technologies such as onion routing can be used to further
  anonymize requests so that requests from a single user at one node on the Internet appear to come
  from many disparate parts of the network.</p>

  <p>However, the IP address used for a user's requests is not the only mechanism by which a user's
  requests could be related to each other. Cookies, for example, are designed specifically to enable
  this, and are the basis of most of the Web's session features that enable you to log into a site
  with which you have an account.</p>

  <p>There are other mechanisms that are more subtle. Certain characteristics of a user's system can
  be used to distinguish groups of users from each other; by collecting enough such information, an
  individual user's browser's "digital fingerprint" can be computed, which can be as good, if not
  better, as an IP address in ascertaining which requests are from the same user.</p>

  <p>Grouping requests in this manner, especially across multiple sites, can be used for both benign
  (and even arguably positive) purposes, as well as for malevolent purposes. An example of a
  reasonably benign purpose would be determining whether a particular person seems to prefer sites
  with dog illustrations as opposed to sites with cat illustrations (based on how often they visit
  the sites in question) and then automatically using the preferred illustrations on subsequent
  visits to participating sites. Malevolent purposes, however, could include governments combining
  information such as the person's home address (determined from the addresses they use when getting
  driving directions on one site) with their apparent political affiliations (determined by
  examining the forum sites that they participate in) to determine whether the person should be
  prevented from voting in an election.</p>

  <p>Since the malevolent purposes can be remarkably evil, user agent implementors are encouraged to
  consider how to provide their users with tools to minimize leaking information that could be used
  to fingerprint a user.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, as the first paragraph in this section implies, sometimes there is great benefit
  to be derived from exposing the very information that can also be used for fingerprinting
  purposes, so it's not as easy as simply blocking all possible leaks. For instance, the ability to
  log into a site to post under a specific identity requires that the user's requests be
  identifiable as all being from the same user, more or less by definition. More subtly, though,
  information such as how wide text is, which is necessary for many effects that involve drawing
  text onto a canvas (e.g. any effect that involves drawing a border around the text) also leaks
  information that can be used to group a user's requests. (In this case, by potentially exposing,
  via a brute force search, which fonts a user has installed, information which can vary
  considerably from user to user.)</p>

  <p>Features in this specification which can be <dfn data-anolis-xref="fingerprinting vector" id="fingerprinting-vector">used to
  fingerprint the user</dfn> are marked as this paragraph is.

  </ul><h3 id="a-quick-introduction-to-html"><span class="secno">1.9 </span>A quick introduction to HTML</h3>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>
  <p>A basic HTML document looks like this:</p>

  <pre id="intro-early-example">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Sample page&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Sample page&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a href="demo.html"&gt;simple&lt;/a&gt; sample.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;!-- this is a comment --&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

  <p>HTML documents consist of a tree of elements and text. Each element is denoted in the source by
  a <a data-anolis-xref="syntax-start-tag" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#syntax-start-tag">start tag</a>, such as "<code data-anolis-xref="">&lt;body&gt;</code>", and
  an <a data-anolis-xref="syntax-end-tag" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#syntax-end-tag">end tag</a>, such as "<code data-anolis-xref="">&lt;/body&gt;</code>".
  (Certain start tags and end tags can in certain cases be <a data-anolis-xref="syntax-tag-omission" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#syntax-tag-omission">omitted</a> and are implied by other tags.)</p>

  <p>Tags have to be nested such that elements are all completely within each other, without
  overlapping:</p>

  <pre class="bad">&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;very &lt;strong&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
  <pre>&lt;p&gt;This &lt;em&gt;is &lt;strong&gt;correct&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

  <p>This specification defines a set of elements that can be used in HTML, along with rules about
  the ways in which the elements can be nested.</p>

  <p>Elements can have attributes, which control how the elements work. In the example below, there
  is a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/links.html#hyperlink">hyperlink</a>, formed using the <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-a-element">a</a></code> element and its <code data-anolis-xref="attr-hyperlink-href"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/links.html#attr-hyperlink-href">href</a></code> attribute:</p>

  <pre>&lt;a href="demo.html"&gt;simple&lt;/a&gt;</pre>

  <p><a data-anolis-xref="syntax-attributes" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#syntax-attributes">Attributes</a> are placed inside the start tag, and consist
  of a <a data-anolis-xref="syntax-attribute-name" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#syntax-attribute-name">name</a> and a <a data-anolis-xref="syntax-attribute-value" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#syntax-attribute-value">value</a>, separated by an "<code data-anolis-xref="">=</code>" character.
  The attribute value can remain <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#unquoted">unquoted</a> if it doesn't contain <a data-anolis-xref="space character" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#space-character">space characters</a> or any of <code data-anolis-xref="">"</code> <code data-anolis-xref="">'</code> <code data-anolis-xref="">`</code> <code data-anolis-xref="">=</code> <code data-anolis-xref="">&lt;</code> or
  <code data-anolis-xref="">&gt;</code>. Otherwise, it has to be quoted using either single or double quotes.
  The value, along with the "<code data-anolis-xref="">=</code>" character, can be omitted altogether if the
  value is the empty string.</p>

  <pre>&lt;!-- empty attributes --&gt;
&lt;input name=address disabled&gt;
&lt;input name=address disabled=""&gt;

&lt;!-- attributes with a value --&gt;
&lt;input name=address maxlength=200&gt;
&lt;input name=address maxlength='200'&gt;
&lt;input name=address maxlength="200"&gt;</pre>

  <p>HTML user agents (e.g. Web browsers) then <i>parse</i> this markup, turning it into a DOM
  (Document Object Model) tree. A DOM tree is an in-memory representation of a document.</p>

  <p>DOM trees contain several kinds of nodes, in particular a <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#documenttype">DocumentType</a></code> node,
  <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#element">Element</a></code> nodes, <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#text-0">Text</a></code> nodes, <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#comment-0">Comment</a></code> nodes, and in some cases
  <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#processinginstruction">ProcessingInstruction</a></code> nodes.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/introduction.html#intro-early-example">markup snippet at the top of this section</a> would be
  turned into the following DOM tree:</p>

  <ul class="domTree"><li class="t10">DOCTYPE: <code data-anolis-xref="">html</code></li><li class="t1"><code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/semantics.html#the-html-element">html</a></code><ul><li class="t1"><code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/document-metadata.html#the-head-element">head</a></code><ul><li class="t3"><code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#text-0">#text</a></code>: <span data-anolis-xref="">⏎␣␣</span></li><li class="t1"><code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/document-metadata.html#the-title-element">title</a></code><ul><li class="t3"><code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#text-0">#text</a></code>: <span data-anolis-xref="">Sample page</span></li></ul></li><li class="t3"><code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#text-0">#text</a></code>: <span data-anolis-xref="">⏎␣</span></li></ul></li><li class="t3"><code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#text-0">#text</a></code>: <span data-anolis-xref="">⏎␣</span></li><li class="t1"><code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#the-body-element">body</a></code><ul><li class="t3"><code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#text-0">#text</a></code>: <span data-anolis-xref="">⏎␣␣</span></li><li class="t1"><code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#the-h1,-h2,-h3,-h4,-h5,-and-h6-elements">h1</a></code><ul><li class="t3"><code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#text-0">#text</a></code>: <span data-anolis-xref="">Sample page</span></li></ul></li><li class="t3"><code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#text-0">#text</a></code>: <span data-anolis-xref="">⏎␣␣</span></li><li class="t1"><code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/grouping-content.html#the-p-element">p</a></code><ul><li class="t3"><code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#text-0">#text</a></code>: <span data-anolis-xref="">This is a  <!--grammar-check-override--></span></li><li class="t1"><code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-a-element">a</a></code> <span class="t2" data-anolis-xref=""><code class="attribute name">href</code>="<code class="attribute value">demo.html</code>"</span><ul><li class="t3"><code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#text-0">#text</a></code>: <span data-anolis-xref="">simple</span></li></ul></li><li class="t3"><code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#text-0">#text</a></code>: <span data-anolis-xref=""> sample.</span></li></ul></li><li class="t3"><code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#text-0">#text</a></code>: <span data-anolis-xref="">⏎␣␣</span></li><li class="t8"><code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#comment-0">#comment</a></code>: <span data-anolis-xref=""> this is a comment </span></li><li class="t3"><code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#text-0">#text</a></code>: <span data-anolis-xref="">⏎␣⏎</span></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#root-element">root element</a> of this tree is the <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/semantics.html#the-html-element">html</a></code> element, which is the
  element always found at the root of HTML documents. It contains two elements, <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/document-metadata.html#the-head-element">head</a></code>
  and <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#the-body-element">body</a></code>, as well as a <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#text-0">Text</a></code> node between them.</p>

  <p>There are many more <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#text-0">Text</a></code> nodes in the DOM tree than one would initially expect,
  because the source contains a number of spaces (represented here by "␣") and line breaks
  ("⏎") that all end up as <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#text-0">Text</a></code> nodes in the DOM. However, for historical
  reasons not all of the spaces and line breaks in the original markup appear in the DOM. In
  particular, all the whitespace before <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/document-metadata.html#the-head-element">head</a></code> start tag ends up being dropped silently,
  and all the whitespace after the <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#the-body-element">body</a></code> end tag ends up placed at the end of the
  <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#the-body-element">body</a></code>.</p>

  <p>The <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/document-metadata.html#the-head-element">head</a></code> element contains a <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/document-metadata.html#the-title-element">title</a></code> element, which itself contains a
  <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#text-0">Text</a></code> node with the text "Sample page". Similarly, the <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#the-body-element">body</a></code> element
  contains an <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#the-h1,-h2,-h3,-h4,-h5,-and-h6-elements">h1</a></code> element, a <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/grouping-content.html#the-p-element">p</a></code> element, and a comment.</p>

  <hr><p>This DOM tree can be manipulated from scripts in the page. Scripts (typically in JavaScript)
  are small programs that can be embedded using the <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/scripting-1.html#the-script-element">script</a></code> element or using <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/webappapis.html#event-handler-content-attributes">event
  handler content attributes</a>. For example, here is a form with a script that sets the value
  of the form's <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#the-output-element">output</a></code> element to say "Hello World":</p>

  <pre>&lt;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#the-form-element">form</a> <a data-anolis-xref="attr-form-name" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#attr-form-name">name</a>="main"&gt;
 Result: &lt;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#the-output-element">output</a> <a data-anolis-xref="attr-fe-name" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#attr-fe-name">name</a>="result"&gt;&lt;/output&gt;
 &lt;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/scripting-1.html#the-script-element">script</a>&gt;
  <a data-anolis-xref="Document" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#document">document</a>.<a data-anolis-xref="dom-document-forms" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#dom-document-forms">forms</a>.main.<a data-anolis-xref="dom-form-elements" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#dom-form-elements">elements</a>.result.<a data-anolis-xref="dom-output-value" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#dom-output-value">value</a> = 'Hello World';
 &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</pre>

  <p>Each element in the DOM tree is represented by an object, and these objects have APIs so that
  they can be manipulated. For instance, a link (e.g. the <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-a-element">a</a></code> element in the tree above)
  can have its "<code data-anolis-xref="attr-hyperlink-href"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/links.html#attr-hyperlink-href">href</a></code>" attribute changed in several
  ways:</p>

  <pre>var a = <a data-anolis-xref="Document" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#document">document</a>.<a data-anolis-xref="dom-document-links" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#dom-document-links">links</a>[0]; // obtain the first link in the document
a.<a data-anolis-xref="dom-url-href" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#dom-url-href">href</a> = 'sample.html'; // change the destination URL of the link
a.<a data-anolis-xref="dom-url-protocol" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#dom-url-protocol">protocol</a> = 'https'; // change just the scheme part of the URL
a.setAttribute('href', 'http://example.com/'); // change the content attribute directly</pre>

  <p>Since DOM trees are used as the way to represent HTML documents when they are processed and
  presented by implementations (especially interactive implementations like Web browsers), this
  specification is mostly phrased in terms of DOM trees, instead of the markup described above.</p>

  <hr><p>HTML documents represent a media-independent description of interactive content. HTML documents
  might be rendered to a screen, or through a speech synthesizer, or on a braille display. To
  influence exactly how such rendering takes place, authors can use a styling language such as
  CSS.</p>

  <p>In the following example, the page has been made yellow-on-blue using CSS.</p>

  <pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Sample styled page&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;style&gt;
   body { background: navy; color: yellow; }
  &lt;/style&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Sample styled page&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This page is just a demo.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

  <p>For more details on how to use HTML, authors are encouraged to consult tutorials and guides.
  Some of the examples included in this specification might also be of use, but the novice author is
  cautioned that this specification, by necessity, defines the language with a level of detail that
  might be difficult to understand at first.</p><!--ADD-TOPIC:Security-->


  <h4 id="writing-secure-applications-with-html"><span class="secno">1.9.1 </span>Writing secure applications with HTML</h4>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>
  <p>When HTML is used to create interactive sites, care needs to be taken to avoid introducing
  vulnerabilities through which attackers can compromise the integrity of the site itself or of the
  site's users.</p>

  <p>A comprehensive study of this matter is beyond the scope of this document, and authors are
  strongly encouraged to study the matter in more detail. However, this section attempts to provide
  a quick introduction to some common pitfalls in HTML application development.</p>

  <p>The security model of the Web is based on the concept of "origins", and correspondingly many of
  the potential attacks on the Web involve cross-origin actions. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/references.html#refsORIGIN">[ORIGIN]</a></p>

  <dl><dt>Not validating user input</dt>
   <dt>Cross-site scripting (XSS)</dt>
   <dt>SQL injection</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>When accepting untrusted input, e.g. user-generated content such as text comments, values in
    URL parameters, messages from third-party sites, etc, it is imperative that the data be
    validated before use, and properly escaped when displayed. Failing to do this can allow a
    hostile user to perform a variety of attacks, ranging from the potentially benign, such as
    providing bogus user information like a negative age, to the serious, such as running scripts
    every time a user looks at a page that includes the information, potentially propagating the
    attack in the process, to the catastrophic, such as deleting all data in the server.</p>

    <p>When writing filters to validate user input, it is imperative that filters always be
    whitelist-based, allowing known-safe constructs and disallowing all other input. Blacklist-based
    filters that disallow known-bad inputs and allow everything else are not secure, as not
    everything that is bad is yet known (for example, because it might be invented in the
    future).</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>For example, suppose a page looked at its URL's query string to determine what to display,
     and the site then redirected the user to that page to display a message, as in:</p>

     <pre>&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="message.cgi?say=Hello"&gt;Say Hello&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="message.cgi?say=Welcome"&gt;Say Welcome&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="message.cgi?say=Kittens"&gt;Say Kittens&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>

     <p>If the message was just displayed to the user without escaping, a hostile attacker could
     then craft a URL that contained a script element:</p>

     <pre>http://example.com/message.cgi?say=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27Oh%20no%21%27%29%3C/script%3E</pre>

     <p>If the attacker then convinced a victim user to visit this page, a script of the attacker's
     choosing would run on the page. Such a script could do any number of hostile actions, limited
     only by what the site offers: if the site is an e-commerce shop, for instance, such a script
     could cause the user to unknowingly make arbitrarily many unwanted purchases.</p>

     <p>This is called a cross-site scripting attack.</p>

    </div>

    <p>There are many constructs that can be used to try to trick a site into executing code. Here
    are some that authors are encouraged to consider when writing whitelist filters:</p>

    <ul><li>When allowing harmless-seeming elements like <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#the-img-element">img</a></code>, it is important to whitelist
     any provided attributes as well. If one allowed all attributes then an attacker could, for
     instance, use the <code data-anolis-xref="handler-onload"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/webappapis.html#handler-onload">onload</a></code> attribute to run arbitrary
     script.</li>

     <li>When allowing URLs to be provided (e.g. for links), the scheme of each URL also needs to be
     explicitly whitelisted, as there are many schemes that can be abused. The most prominent
     example is "<code data-anolis-xref="javascript-protocol">javascript:</code>", but user agents can
     implement (and indeed, have historically implemented) others.</li><!-- IE had vbscript:,
     Netscape had livescript:, etc. --> 

     <li>Allowing a <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/document-metadata.html#the-base-element">base</a></code> element to be inserted means any <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/scripting-1.html#the-script-element">script</a></code> elements
     in the page with relative links can be hijacked, and similarly that any form submissions can
     get redirected to a hostile site.</li>

    </ul></dd>


   <dt>Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>If a site allows a user to make form submissions with user-specific side-effects, for example
    posting messages on a forum under the user's name, making purchases, or applying for a passport,
    it is important to verify that the request was made by the user intentionally, rather than by
    another site tricking the user into making the request unknowingly.</p>

    <p>This problem exists because HTML forms can be submitted to other origins.</p>

    <p>Sites can prevent such attacks by populating forms with user-specific hidden tokens, or by
    checking <code data-anolis-xref="http-origin">Origin</code> headers on all requests.</p>

   </dd>



   <dt>Clickjacking</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>A page that provides users with an interface to perform actions that the user might not wish
    to perform needs to be designed so as to avoid the possibility that users can be tricked into
    activating the interface.</p>

    <p>One way that a user could be so tricked is if a hostile site places the victim site in a
    small <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#the-iframe-element">iframe</a></code> and then convinces the user to click, for instance by having the user
    play a reaction game. Once the user is playing the game, the hostile site can quickly position
    the iframe under the mouse cursor just as the user is about to click, thus tricking the user
    into clicking the victim site's interface.</p>

    <p>To avoid this, sites that do not expect to be used in frames are encouraged to only enable
    their interface if they detect that they are not in a frame (e.g. by comparing the <code data-anolis-xref="dom-window"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#dom-window">window</a></code> object to the value of the <code data-anolis-xref="dom-top"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#dom-top">top</a></code>
    attribute).</p>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>
  <p>Scripts in HTML have "run-to-completion" semantics, meaning that the browser will generally run
  the script uninterrupted before doing anything else, such as firing further events or continuing
  to parse the document.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, parsing of HTML files happens asynchronously and incrementally, meaning that
  the parser can pause at any point to let scripts run. This is generally a good thing, but it does
  mean that authors need to be careful to avoid hooking event handlers after the events could have
  possibly fired.</p>

  <p>There are two techniques for doing this reliably: use <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/webappapis.html#event-handler-content-attributes">event handler content
  attributes</a>, or create the element and add the event handlers in the same script. The latter
  is safe because, as mentioned earlier, scripts are run to completion before further events can
  fire.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>One way this could manifest itself is with <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#the-img-element">img</a></code> elements and the <code data-anolis-xref="event-load">load</code> event. The event could fire as soon as the element has been
   parsed, especially if the image has already been cached (which is common).</p>

   <p>Here, the author uses the <code data-anolis-xref="handler-onload"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/webappapis.html#handler-onload">onload</a></code> handler on an
   <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#the-img-element">img</a></code> element to catch the <code data-anolis-xref="event-load">load</code> event:</p>

   <pre>&lt;img src="games.png" alt="Games" onload="gamesLogoHasLoaded(event)"&gt;</pre>

   <p>If the element is being added by script, then so long as the event handlers are added in the
   same script, the event will still not be missed:</p>

   <pre>&lt;script&gt;
 var img = new Image();
 img.src = 'games.png';
 img.alt = 'Games';
 img.onload = gamesLogoHasLoaded;
 // img.addEventListener('load', gamesLogoHasLoaded, false); // would work also
&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

   <p>However, if the author first created the <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#the-img-element">img</a></code> element and then in a separate
   script added the event listeners, there's a chance that the <code data-anolis-xref="event-load">load</code>
   event would be fired in between, leading it to be missed:</p>

   <pre class="bad">&lt;!-- Do not use this style, it has a race condition!--&gt;
 &lt;img id="games" src="games.png" alt="Games"&gt;
 &lt;!-- the 'load' event might fire here while the parser is taking a
      break, in which case you will not see it!--&gt;
 &lt;script&gt;
  var img = document.getElementById('games');
  img.onload = gamesLogoHasLoaded; // might never fire!
 &lt;/script&gt;</pre>

  </div>

  <p>Authors are encouraged to make use of conformance checkers (also known as <i>validators</i>) to

  <h3 id="conformance-requirements-for-authors"><span class="secno">1.10 </span>Conformance requirements for authors</h3>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>
  <p>Unlike previous versions of the HTML specification, this specification defines in some detail
  the required processing for invalid documents as well as valid documents.</p><!-- This has led to
  some questioning the purpose of conformance criteria: if there is no ambiguity in how something
  will be processed, why disallow it? --> 

  <p>However, even though the processing of invalid content is in most cases well-defined,
  conformance requirements for documents are still important: in practice, interoperability (the
  situation in which all implementations process particular content in a reliable and identical or
  equivalent way) is not the only goal of document conformance requirements. This section details
  some of the more common reasons for still distinguishing between a conforming document and one
  with errors.</p>


  <h4 id="presentational-markup"><span class="secno">1.10.1 </span>Presentational markup</h4>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>
  <p>The majority of presentational features from previous versions of HTML are no longer allowed.
  Presentational markup in general has been found to have a number of problems:</p>

  <dl><dt>The use of presentational elements leads to poorer accessibility</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>While it is possible to use presentational markup in a way that provides users of assistive
    technologies (ATs) with an acceptable experience (e.g. using ARIA), doing so is significantly
    more difficult than doing so when using semantically-appropriate markup. Furthermore, even using
    such techniques doesn't help make pages accessible for non-AT non-graphical users, such as users
    of text-mode browsers.</p>

    <p>Using media-independent markup, on the other hand, provides an easy way for documents to be
    authored in such a way that they work for more users (e.g. text browsers).</p>

   </dd>


   <dt>Higher cost of maintenance</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>It is significantly easier to maintain a site written in such a way that the markup is
    style-independent. For example, changing the color of a site that uses
    <code>&lt;font&nbsp;color=""&gt;</code> throughout requires changes across the entire site, whereas
    a similar change to a site based on CSS can be done by changing a single file.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt>Larger document sizes</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Presentational markup tends to be much more redundant, and thus results in larger document
    sizes.</p>

   </dd>

  </dl><p>For those reasons, presentational markup has been removed from HTML in this version. This
  change should not come as a surprise; HTML4 deprecated presentational markup many years ago and
  provided a mode (HTML4 Transitional) to help authors move away from presentational markup; later,
  XHTML 1.1 went further and obsoleted those features altogether.</p>

  <p>The only remaining presentational markup features in HTML are the <code data-anolis-xref="attr-style"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#the-style-attribute">style</a></code> attribute and the <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/document-metadata.html#the-style-element">style</a></code> element. Use of the <code data-anolis-xref="attr-style"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#the-style-attribute">style</a></code> attribute is somewhat discouraged in production environments, but
  it can be useful for rapid prototyping (where its rules can be directly moved into a separate
  style sheet later) and for providing specific styles in unusual cases where a separate style sheet
  would be inconvenient. Similarly, the <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/document-metadata.html#the-style-element">style</a></code> element can be useful in syndication or
  for page-specific styles, but in general an external style sheet is likely to be more convenient
  when the styles apply to multiple pages.</p>

  <p>It is also worth noting that some elements that were previously presentational have been
  redefined in this specification to be media-independent: <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-b-element">b</a></code>, <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-i-element">i</a></code>,
  <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/grouping-content.html#the-hr-element">hr</a></code>, <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-s-element">s</a></code>, <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-small-element">small</a></code>, and <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-u-element">u</a></code>.</p>


  <h4 id="syntax-errors"><span class="secno">1.10.2 </span>Syntax errors</h4>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>
  <p>The syntax of HTML is constrained to avoid a wide variety of problems.</p>

  <dl><dt>Unintuitive error-handling behavior</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Certain invalid syntax constructs, when parsed, result in DOM trees that are highly
    unintuitive.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>For example, the following markup fragment results in a DOM with an <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/grouping-content.html#the-hr-element">hr</a></code> element
     that is an <em>earlier</em> sibling of the corresponding <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/tabular-data.html#the-table-element">table</a></code> element:</p>

     <pre class="bad">&lt;table&gt;&lt;hr&gt;...</pre>

    </div>

   </dd>


   <dt>Errors with optional error recovery</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>To allow user agents to be used in controlled environments without having to implement the
    more bizarre and convoluted error handling rules, user agents are permitted to fail whenever
    encountering a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#parse-error">parse error</a>.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt>Errors where the error-handling behavior is not compatible with streaming user agents</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Some error-handling behavior, such as the behavior for the <code data-anolis-xref="">&lt;table&gt;&lt;hr&gt;...</code> example mentioned above, are incompatible with streaming
    user agents (user agents that process HTML files in one pass, without storing state). To avoid
    interoperability problems with such user agents, any syntax resulting in such behavior is
    considered invalid.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt>Errors that can result in infoset coercion</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>When a user agent based on XML is connected to an HTML parser, it is possible that certain
    invariants that XML enforces, such as comments never containing two consecutive hyphens, will be
    violated by an HTML file. Handling this can require that the parser coerce the HTML DOM into an
    XML-compatible infoset. Most syntax constructs that require such handling are considered
    invalid.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt>Errors that result in disproportionally poor performance</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Certain syntax constructs can result in disproportionally poor performance. To discourage the
    use of such constructs, they are typically made non-conforming.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>For example, the following markup results in poor performance, since all the unclosed
     <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-i-element">i</a></code> elements have to be reconstructed in each paragraph, resulting in progressively
     more elements in each paragraph:</p>

     <pre class="bad">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;He dreamt.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;He dreamt that he ate breakfast.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Then lunch.

   </dd>


   <dt>Errors involving fragile syntax constructs</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>There are syntax constructs that, for historical reasons, are relatively fragile. To help
    reduce the number of users who accidentally run into such problems, they are made
    non-conforming.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>For example, the parsing of certain named character references in attributes happens even
     with the closing semicolon being omitted. It is safe to include an ampersand followed by
     letters that do not form a named character reference, but if the letters are changed to a
     string that <em>does</em> form a named character reference, they will be interpreted as that
     character instead.</p>

     <p>In this fragment, the attribute's value is "<code data-anolis-xref="">?bill&amp;ted</code>":</p>

     <pre class="bad">&lt;a href="?bill&amp;ted"&gt;Bill and Ted&lt;/a&gt;</pre>

     <p>In the following fragment, however, the attribute's value is actually "<code data-anolis-xref="">?art©</code>", <em>not</em> the intended "<code data-anolis-xref="">?art&amp;copy</code>",
     because even without the final semicolon, "<code data-anolis-xref="">&amp;copy</code>" is handled the same
     as "<code data-anolis-xref="">&amp;copy;</code>" and thus gets interpreted as "<code data-anolis-xref="">©</code>":</p>

     <pre class="bad">&lt;a href="?art&amp;copy"&gt;Art and Copy&lt;/a&gt;</pre>

     <p>To avoid this problem, all named character references are required to end with a semicolon,
     and uses of named character references without a semicolon are flagged as errors.</p>

     <p>Thus, the correct way to express the above cases is as
     follows:</p>

     <pre>&lt;a href="?bill&amp;ted"&gt;Bill and Ted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;!-- &amp;ted is ok, since it's not a named character reference --&gt;</pre>
     <pre>&lt;a href="?art&amp;amp;copy"&gt;Art and Copy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;!-- the &amp; has to be escaped, since &amp;copy <em>is</em> a named character reference --&gt;</pre>

    </div>

   </dd>


   <dt>Errors involving known interoperability problems in legacy user agents</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Certain syntax constructs are known to cause especially subtle or serious problems in legacy
    user agents, and are therefore marked as non-conforming to help authors avoid them.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>For example, this is why the "`" (U+0060) character is not allowed in unquoted
     attributes. In certain legacy user agents,  <!-- namely IE -->  it is sometimes treated as a
     quote character.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="example">

     <p>Another example of this is the DOCTYPE, which is required to trigger <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#no-quirks-mode">no-quirks
     mode</a>, because the behavior of legacy user agents in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#quirks-mode">quirks mode</a> is often
     largely undocumented.</p>

    </div>

   </dd><!--ADD-TOPIC:Security-->



   <dt>Errors that risk exposing authors to security attacks</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Certain restrictions exist purely to avoid known security problems.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>For example, the restriction on using UTF-7 exists purely to avoid authors falling prey to a
     known cross-site-scripting attack using UTF-7. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/references.html#refsUTF7">[UTF7]</a></p>

    </div>

   </dd><!--REMOVE-TOPIC:Security-->



   <dt>Cases where the author's intent is unclear</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Markup where the author's intent is very unclear is often made non-conforming. Correcting
    these errors early makes later maintenance easier.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>For example, it is unclear whether the author intended the following to be an
     <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#the-h1,-h2,-h3,-h4,-h5,-and-h6-elements">h1</a></code> heading or an <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#the-h1,-h2,-h3,-h4,-h5,-and-h6-elements">h2</a></code> heading:</p>

     <pre class="bad">&lt;h1&gt;Contact details&lt;/h2&gt;</pre>

    </div>

   </dd>


   <dt>Cases that are likely to be typos</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>When a user makes a simple typo, it is helpful if the error can be caught early, as this can
    save the author a lot of debugging time. This specification therefore usually considers it an
    error to use element names, attribute names, and so forth, that do not match the names defined
    in this specification.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>For example, if the author typed <code>&lt;capton&gt;</code> instead of
     <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/tabular-data.html#the-caption-element">&lt;caption&gt;</a></code>, this would be flagged as an error and the author could correct the
     typo immediately.</p>

    </div>

   </dd>


   <dt>Errors that could interfere with new syntax in the future</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>In order to allow the language syntax to be extended in the future, certain otherwise
    harmless features are disallowed.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>For example, "attributes" in end tags are ignored currently, but they are invalid, in case a
     future change to the language makes use of that syntax feature without conflicting with
     already-deployed (and valid!) content.</p>

    </div>

   </dd>


  </dl><p>Some authors find it helpful to be in the practice of always quoting all attributes and always
  including all optional tags, preferring the consistency derived from such custom over the minor
  benefits of terseness afforded by making use of the flexibility of the HTML syntax. To aid such
  authors, conformance checkers can provide modes of operation wherein such conventions are
  enforced.</p>



  <h4 id="restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values"><span class="secno">1.10.3 </span>Restrictions on content models and on attribute values</h4>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>
  <p>Beyond the syntax of the language, this specification also places restrictions on how elements
  and attributes can be specified. These restrictions are present for similar reasons:</p>

  <dl><dt>Errors involving content with dubious semantics</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>To avoid misuse of elements with defined meanings, content models are defined that restrict
    how elements can be nested when such nestings would be of dubious value.</p>

    <p class="example">For example, this specification disallows nesting a <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#the-section-element">section</a></code>
    element inside a <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-kbd-element">kbd</a></code> element, since it is highly unlikely for an author to indicate
    that an entire section should be keyed in.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt>Errors that involve a conflict in expressed semantics</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Similarly, to draw the author's attention to mistakes in the use of elements, clear
    contradictions in the semantics expressed are also considered conformance errors.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>In the fragments below, for example, the semantics are nonsensical: a separator cannot
     simultaneously be a cell, nor can a radio button be a progress bar.</p>

     <pre class="bad">&lt;hr role="cell"&gt;</pre>
     <pre class="bad">&lt;input type=radio role=progressbar&gt;</pre>

    </div>

    <p class="example">Another example is the restrictions on the content models of the
    <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/grouping-content.html#the-ul-element">ul</a></code> element, which only allows <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/grouping-content.html#the-li-element">li</a></code> element children. Lists by definition
    consist just of zero or more list items, so if a <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/grouping-content.html#the-ul-element">ul</a></code> element contains something
    other than an <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/grouping-content.html#the-li-element">li</a></code> element, it's not clear what was meant.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt>Cases where the default styles are likely to lead to confusion</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Certain elements have default styles or behaviors that make certain combinations likely to
    lead to confusion. Where these have equivalent alternatives without this problem, the confusing
    combinations are disallowed.</p>

    <p class="example">For example, <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/grouping-content.html#the-div-element">div</a></code> elements are rendered as block boxes, and
    <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-span-element">span</a></code> elements as inline boxes. Putting a block box in an inline box is
    unnecessarily confusing; since either nesting just <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/grouping-content.html#the-div-element">div</a></code> elements, or nesting just
    <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-span-element">span</a></code> elements, or nesting <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-span-element">span</a></code> elements inside <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/grouping-content.html#the-div-element">div</a></code>
    elements all serve the same purpose as nesting a <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/grouping-content.html#the-div-element">div</a></code> element in a <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-span-element">span</a></code>
    element, but only the latter involves a block box in an inline box, the latter combination is
    disallowed.</p>

    <p class="example">Another example would be the way <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#interactive-content-0">interactive content</a> cannot be
    nested. For example, a <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#the-button-element">button</a></code> element cannot contain a <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#the-textarea-element">textarea</a></code>
    element. This is because the default behavior of such nesting interactive elements would be
    highly confusing to users. Instead of nesting these elements, they can be placed side by
    side.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt>Errors that indicate a likely misunderstanding of the specification</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Sometimes, something is disallowed because allowing it would likely cause author
    confusion.</p>

    <p class="example">For example, setting the <code data-anolis-xref="attr-fe-disabled"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#attr-fe-disabled">disabled</a></code>
    attribute to the value "<code data-anolis-xref="">false</code>" is disallowed, because despite the
    appearance of meaning that the element is enabled, it in fact means that the element is
    <em>disabled</em> (what matters for implementations is the presence of the attribute, not its
    value).</p>

   </dd>


   <dt>Errors involving limits that have been imposed merely to simplify the language</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Some conformance errors simplify the language that authors need to learn.</p>

    <p class="example">For example, the <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#the-area-element">area</a></code> element's <code data-anolis-xref="attr-area-shape"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#attr-area-shape">shape</a></code> attribute, despite accepting both <code data-anolis-xref="attr-area-shape-keyword-circ"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#attr-area-shape-keyword-circ">circ</a></code> and <code data-anolis-xref="attr-area-shape-keyword-circle"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#attr-area-shape-keyword-circle">circle</a></code> values in practice as synonyms, disallows
    the use of the <code data-anolis-xref="attr-area-shape-keyword-circ"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#attr-area-shape-keyword-circ">circ</a></code> value, so as to simplify
    tutorials and other learning aids. There would be no benefit to allowing both, but it would
    cause extra confusion when teaching the language.</p>

   <dt>Errors that involve peculiarities of the parser</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Certain elements are parsed in somewhat eccentric ways (typically for historical reasons),
    and their content model restrictions are intended to avoid exposing the author to these
    issues.</p>

    <div class="example">

     <p>For example, a <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#the-form-element">form</a></code> element isn't allowed inside <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#phrasing-content-1">phrasing content</a>,
     because when parsed as HTML, a <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#the-form-element">form</a></code> element's start tag will imply a
     <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/grouping-content.html#the-p-element">p</a></code> element's end tag. Thus, the following markup results in two <a data-anolis-xref="paragraph" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#paragraph">paragraphs</a>, not one:</p>

     <pre>&lt;p&gt;Welcome. &lt;form&gt;&lt;label&gt;Name:&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input&gt;&lt;/form&gt;</pre>

     <p>It is parsed exactly like the following:</p>

     <pre>&lt;p&gt;Welcome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;form&gt;&lt;label&gt;Name:&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input&gt;&lt;/form&gt;</pre>

    </div>

   </dd>


   <dt>Errors that would likely result in scripts failing in hard-to-debug ways</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Some errors are intended to help prevent script problems that would be hard to debug.</p>

    <p class="example">This is why, for instance, it is non-conforming to have two <code data-anolis-xref="attr-id"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#the-id-attribute">id</a></code> attributes with the same value. Duplicate IDs lead to the wrong
    element being selected, with sometimes disastrous effects whose cause is hard to determine.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt>Errors that waste authoring time</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Some constructs are disallowed because historically they have been the cause of a lot of
    wasted authoring time, and by encouraging authors to avoid making them, authors can save time in
    future efforts.</p>

    <p class="example">For example, a <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/scripting-1.html#the-script-element">script</a></code> element's <code data-anolis-xref="attr-script-src"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/scripting-1.html#attr-script-src">src</a></code> attribute causes the element's contents to be ignored.
    However, this isn't obvious, especially if the element's contents appear to be executable script
    — which can lead to authors spending a lot of time trying to debug the inline script
    without realizing that it is not executing. To reduce this problem, this specification makes it
    non-conforming to have executable script in a <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/scripting-1.html#the-script-element">script</a></code> element when the <code data-anolis-xref="attr-script-src"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/scripting-1.html#attr-script-src">src</a></code> attribute is present. This means that authors who are
    validating their documents are less likely to waste time with this kind of mistake.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt>Errors that involve areas that affect authors migrating to and from XHTML</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Some authors like to write files that can be interpreted as both XML and HTML with similar
    results. Though this practice is discouraged in general due to the myriad of subtle
    complications involved (especially when involving scripting, styling, or any kind of automated
    serialization), this specification has a few restrictions intended to at least somewhat mitigate
    the difficulties. This makes it easier for authors to use this as a transitionary step when
    migrating between HTML and XHTML.</p>

    <p class="example">For example, there are somewhat complicated rules surrounding the <code data-anolis-xref="attr-lang"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#attr-lang">lang</a></code> and <code data-anolis-xref="attr-xml-lang"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#attr-xml-lang">xml:lang</a></code> attributes
    intended to keep the two synchronized.</p>

    <p class="example">Another example would be the restrictions on the values of <code data-anolis-xref="">xmlns</code> attributes in the HTML serialization, which are intended to ensure that
    elements in conforming documents end up in the same namespaces whether processed as HTML or
    XML.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt>Errors that involve areas reserved for future expansion</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>As with the restrictions on the syntax intended to allow for new syntax in future revisions
    of the language, some restrictions on the content models of elements and values of attributes
    are intended to allow for future expansion of the HTML vocabulary.</p>

    <p class="example">For example, limiting the values of the <code data-anolis-xref="attr-hyperlink-target"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/links.html#attr-hyperlink-target">target</a></code> attribute that start with an "_" (U+005F) character to only specific predefined values allows new predefined values to be introduced
    at a future time without conflicting with author-defined values.</p>

   </dd>


   <dt>Errors that indicate a mis-use of other specifications</dt>

   <dd>

    <p>Certain restrictions are intended to support the restrictions made by other
    specifications.</p>

    <p class="example">For example, requiring that attributes that take media queries use only
    <em>valid</em> media queries reinforces the importance of following the conformance rules of
    that specification.</p>
